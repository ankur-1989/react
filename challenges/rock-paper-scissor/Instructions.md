4. [x] Game stores and displays current score.

## User Story Back:

### Technical constrains:

Use ReactJS, to allow us to assess your level of comfort with it.
It does not need to have a flashy GUI - it can be a really simple page, but it needs to respond fine on different screen sizes. The page styling should show a basic understanding of esthetics and contemporary (e.g. material) design principles without being too elaborate.
Focus on: CSS (do not use a framework like Bootstrap), Javascript code quality, best practices and design patterns (Model and Controller parts of MVC concept).

[In case you do not know the game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors)

## Guidance:

It should take around 3 - 5 hours of effort when doing this, so please use this as an indicator of effort required.
Regarding UI - that can be a simple web page but it should "make sense" in terms of UX, style and responsiveness
I am keen to see how much you think is enough, and how much would go into a Minimum Viable Product. As a guide, elegant and simple wins over feature rich every time, though extra gold stars are given to people who get excited and do more because they are having fun.
Do you test drive your code? This is something we value at Legal One, and we will be looking for that in the code you produce.  
I also consider the extensibility of the code produced. Well factored code should be relatively easily extended. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock may be a natural extension.
Nice feature would be if for instance score is saved on browser's memory so that the game is not lost if user refreshes the page by accident. This is a bonus task just if you finish everything else and you feel like playing a bit.
Hint - spend some time on doing a research and find the best and simplest algorithm for the game.
